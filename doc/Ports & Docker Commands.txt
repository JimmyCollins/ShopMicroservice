Commands to setup docker images:

Start MYSQL:

docker run -p 3306:3306 --name shopdb2 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -d jimmyc/mysql

(do i need to create the mysql database again - resave docker image after adding tables and try next time..)

TODO - Are the below right - do we need to run a specific command to ensure the containers that need to talk to MYSQL can? >> see “Connect to MySQL from an application in another Docker container” at this link - https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql/.


Start the services:

docker run -p 3001:3001 -d jimmyc/user-service
docker run -p 3003:3003 -d jimmyc/cart-service
docker run -p 3004:3004 -d jimmyc/stock-service
docker run -p 8079:8079 -d jimmyc/front-end
docker run -p 3002:3002 -d jimmyc/catalogue-service

Still an error right now:

Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:3002
    at Object.exports._errnoException (util.js:1018:11)
    at exports._exceptionWithHostPort (util.js:1041:20)
    at TCPConnectWrap.afterConnect [as oncomplete] (net.js:1090:14)

Try to fix as per TODO above?

Fixed issue with front-end trying to contact catalogie on localhost (set catalogue ip to 192.168.99.100 in front-end code).

Now looks like the catalog service is trying to contact the DB on localhost, going to try changing DB IP to 192.168.99.100 in catalogue service code.

Fixed - anyway around hard coding the docker container IP's in the code?
