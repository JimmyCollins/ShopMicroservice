Cloud Foundry Deployment steps

Create app in Bluemix first (use uniquq URL's for each service??)

Open CMD
cf login
Create manifest.yml file in app dir - see front-end as an example
cf push to send to bluemix

cf apps to see apps


cf env -app_name (e.g. cf env -shop) to see env vars

FOCUS ON GETTING CATALOGUE CONNECTED TO DB FIRST? - how to setup DB in CF?

THEN FRONT-END CONNECTED TO CATALOGE

TODO

Can't seem to get env vars - focus on getting some of the vars output on the front-end

SUNDAY

Created a new DB using ClearDB
Bound this to the catalogue service using the Bluemix UI
Used cf env -app_name to get the connection details
Connected to the DB via MySQL Workbench - created schema

Still can't connect - services seem to be running on port 8080 but can't reach them...

Looks like this guy done the same as me - https://developer.ibm.com/answers/questions/196435/cant-connect-to-cleardb-from-nodejs-app-on-bluemix.html

I setup phpMyAdmin in order to be able to admin my db - https://phpmyadmin-shop-jc.mybluemix.net/

MONDAY

Finish design document
Document deployment process
Go back to feature dev

Limitation of ClearDB - Only 4 concurrent connections are allowed - should be OK.
