## Cloud Development Frameworks Assignment

This application formed part of the requirements of my MSc. Software Engineering degree.

#### Objective

The objective of this assignment was to create a collection of microservices and a user interface to demonstrate them. I based mine around a high-end car sales website, comprised of a number of services, namely services for cart, catalogue, orders, stock and users.

For the development I used the ExpressJS framework for Node.js.
